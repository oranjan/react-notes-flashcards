# React Notes and Flashcards

Welcome to the React Notes and Flashcards repository, a valuable resource for learning and mastering React. We've curated a collection of flashcards and useful information to aid your journey.

## Logical Operators

Understanding logical operators is fundamental in React development:

- **`&&` Operator**: It evaluates expressions and seeks the first falsy value.
- **`||` Operator**: It evaluates expressions and looks for the first truthy value.

## JSON.stringify()

The `JSON.stringify()` method is a powerful tool for converting JavaScript values into JSON strings.

- **Usage**: `JSON.stringify(value)`
- **Usage with Options**: `JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space)` (optional parameters)

## JSON.parse()

When you need to parse a JSON string and transform it into a JavaScript object, rely on the `JSON.parse()` method.

## Window: localStorage Property

Understanding the `localStorage` property and its differences from `sessionStorage` is crucial:

- **Comparison with `sessionStorage`**: Unlike `localStorage`, data stored in `sessionStorage` vanishes when the page session ends, typically upon closing the page. Be aware that `localStorage` data associated with a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is wiped when the last "private" tab is closed.

- **Handling Empty Keys**: If a key is empty, `localStorage` returns `null`.

- **Usage**:
  - `localStorage.setItem("key", "value")` (Note: The value should be in string format)
  - `localStorage.getItem("key")`

## `useState` Lazy Initialization

Optimize the performance of your React components by using `useState` lazy initialization when dealing with heavy computations or IO operations.

```javascript
const value = SomethingHeavyComputationally(); // It could be any IO operation.

// To avoid re-running heavy computations, use lazy initialization:
const [state, setState] = useState(value);

// Alternatively, create a function that only runs during the initial render, achieving lazy initial state loading.
// const value = () => SomethingHeavyComputationally();
```

## React Event Handlers

In React components, event handlers automatically receive an event object as a parameter when invoked. Here's an example:

```javascript
const text = "A brown fox jumped over...";

const subtext = text.split("x");

console.log(subtext); // ["A brown fo",""]
```

## File Paths

Understanding absolute and relative file paths is essential:

- Absolute Path: `/path/to/your/file`
- Relative Path: `./relative/path/to/your/file`

## NavLink Styling

You can style NavLink components using a function or class based on the current route:

Example: Styling the "About" link in the navbar. If you're on the "About" page, the link is red; otherwise, it's the normal color.

```javascript
const styles = {
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  textDecoration: 'underline',
  color: "#161616"
};

<NavLink
  style={({ isActive }) => isActive ? styles : {}}
  About
</NavLink>

// You can also use a class:
className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? "my-link" : null }
```

## Understanding `.parse` and `.json()`

Differentiating between `.parse()` and `.json()` in JavaScript:

1. `.parse`:
   - Use `.parse()` to convert a JSON-formatted string into a JavaScript object.

2. `.json()`:
   - Employ `.json()` in HTTP requests to extract and parse JSON response data.

## React `useEffect`

A practical example of using `useEffect` to fetch data from an API:

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      console.log(jsonData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

Replace `apiUrl` with your actual API endpoint.

## Daily Update 17 oct' 23
-  Today, I've studied for 5.5 hours, and it feels great. I'm wearing an extra layer because it's cold outside, but the nice weather makes it worth it. Hopefully, the extra layer will keep me from getting sick.

## Navigating Directories

To navigate to the previous directory, use the following command:

```bash
cd ..
```

To stay in the current directory, use:

```bash
cd .
```

## File Paths

An absolute path specifies the exact location of a file or directory in the file system, starting from the root directory. For example, an absolute path might look like this:

Absolute Path: `C:/folder1/images/wallpaper/1`

On the other hand, a relative path specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to your current working directory. For instance, if you are already in the `folder1` directory and you want to specify the path to `1`, the relative path would be:

Relative Path: `images/wallpaper/1`

You don't need to include the starting directory (`folder1`) because you're already in it. This relative path tells the system to go from the current directory (`folder1`) into the `images` directory and then into the `wallpaper` directory to access the `1` file.

## Path vs. Route

1. **Path (URL Path):** In the context of a web browser, the "Path" refers to the portion of the URL that specifies the location of a specific resource (usually a web page) on a web server. For example, in the URL "https://www.example.com/products/laptops," the path is "/products/laptops." It helps the web server determine which resource to serve or which route to take in the application. In a web application, the path is used to navigate between different pages or components.

2. **Route (React Router Route):** In React and React Router, a "Route" is a component used to define the mapping between a URL path and a specific component to be rendered when that path is visited. React Router is a library for handling routing and navigation in React applications.

## React Router Example

```jsx
<Link
    to=".."
    relative="path" // Relative to path, not route (default, which matches path with component)
    className="back-button"
>
  &larr; <span>Back to all vans</span>
</Link>

<NavLink to="." 
    end // "/host/vans/1" only matches with the exact same path
    // Without 'end', NavLink can match with similar child paths
    // e.g., /host/vans/1/pricing or /host/vans/1/x/y, etc.
    style={({ isActive }) => isActive ? activeStyles : {}}
>
```

## Job Searching and Resume Tips

- When job hunting, target positions and salary goals.
- Make a list of potential employers.
- Connect with HRs, engineering managers of startups, or SDEs.
- Consider using optional notes for referrals and share a bitly link to your resume.
- Don't hesitate to apply, even if you're not entirely eligible (e.g., if you have 2 years of experience).
- Latest interview experiences can be a sign that a company is actively hiring.
- Save the contact information of recruiters.
- Consider mock interviews to prepare effectively.
- Tailor your resume, highlight good projects, focus on JavaScript-specific LeetCode, and emphasize your open-source contributions.
- When explaining projects on your resume, assume the reader knows very little and emphasize metrics, bold features, and the tech stack. Place the most important information in the top-left corner.

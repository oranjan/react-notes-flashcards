## Logical Operators

Understanding logical operators is fundamental in React development:

- **`&&` Operator**: It evaluates expressions and seeks the first falsy value.
- **`||` Operator**: It evaluates expressions and looks for the first truthy value.

## JSON.stringify()

The `JSON.stringify()` method is a powerful tool for converting JavaScript values into JSON strings.

- **Usage**: `JSON.stringify(value)`
- **Usage with Options**: `JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space)` (optional parameters)

## JSON.parse()

When you need to parse a JSON string and transform it into a JavaScript object, rely on the `JSON.parse()` method.

## Window: localStorage Property

Understanding the `localStorage` property and its differences from `sessionStorage` is crucial:

- **Comparison with `sessionStorage`**: Unlike `localStorage`, data stored in `sessionStorage` vanishes when the page session ends, typically upon closing the page. Be aware that `localStorage` data associated with a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is wiped when the last "private" tab is closed.

- **Handling Empty Keys**: If a key is empty, `localStorage` returns `null`.

- **Usage**:
  - `localStorage.setItem("key", "value")` (Note: The value should be in string format)
  - `localStorage.getItem("key")`

## `useState` Lazy Initialization

Optimize the performance of your React components by using `useState` lazy initialization when dealing with heavy computations or IO operations.

```javascript
const value = SomethingHeavyComputationally(); // It could be any IO operation.

// To avoid re-running heavy computations, use lazy initialization:
const [state, setState] = useState(value);

// Alternatively, create a function that only runs during the initial render, achieving lazy initial state loading.
// const value = () => SomethingHeavyComputationally();
```

## React Event Handlers

In React components, event handlers automatically receive an event object as a parameter when invoked. Here's an example:

```javascript
const text = "A brown fox jumped over...";

const subtext = text.split("x");

console.log(subtext); // ["A brown fo",""]
```

## File Paths

Understanding absolute and relative file paths is essential:

- Absolute Path: `/path/to/your/file`
- Relative Path: `./relative/path/to/your/file`

## NavLink Styling

You can style NavLink components using a function or class based on the current route:

Example: Styling the "About" link in the navbar. If you're on the "About" page, the link is red; otherwise, it's the normal color.

```javascript
const styles = {
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  textDecoration: 'underline',
  color: "#161616"
};

<NavLink
  style={({ isActive }) => isActive ? styles : {}}
  About
</NavLink>

// You can also use a class:
className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? "my-link" : null }
```

## Understanding `.parse` and `.json()`

Differentiating between `.parse()` and `.json()` in JavaScript:

1. `.parse`:
   - Use `.parse()` to convert a JSON-formatted string into a JavaScript object.

2. `.json()`:
   - Employ `.json()` in HTTP requests to extract and parse JSON response data.

## React `useEffect`

A practical example of using `useEffect` to fetch data from an API:

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      console.log(jsonData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

Replace `apiUrl` with your actual API endpoint.

## Daily Update 17 oct' 23
-  Today, I've studied for 5.5 hours, and it feels great. I'm wearing an extra layer because it's cold outside, but the nice weather makes it worth it. Hopefully, the extra layer will keep me from getting sick.
